.. _Scripting_:

Scripting
=========

To learn more about interacting with the SHARPpy libraries using the Python
programming language, see the tutorial listed in tutorials/ and check out the link:

http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/sharppy/SHARPpy/blob/master/tutorials/SHARPpy_basics.ipynb

This tutorial will provide examples for how to use the Python scripting language and SHARPpy to read in the tabular data and work with many of the relevant routines used in the SHARPpy GUI (e.g., CAPE, STP, SCP, SRH calculations).

To write scripts interacting with the SHARPpy libraries, you do NOT have to have the PySide package installed.
