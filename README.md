SHARPpy
=======
Sounding/Hodograph Analysis and Research Program in Python

This is primarily tested and used with the Anaconda Python Distribution
from Continuum Analytics, running Python 2.7. Python 3+ is currently
not supported, but we are working towards it. Anaconda can be downloaded
here: https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/

To install the SHARPpy package into your Python path, type:

python setup.py install

To run the SHARPpy GUI, you will need both Numpy and PySide installed
with your Python distribution.  To run the gui, copy the runsharp folder
to the location at which you wish to run the program. Navigate to that
folder in your terminal and run the following command:

python full_gui.py
