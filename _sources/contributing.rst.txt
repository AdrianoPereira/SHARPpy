Contributing
============

So, you'd like to contribute to the SHARPpy project, eh?  What the heck is a pull request, anyways?  Regardless of your coding experience, congratulations!  You've take the first step to helping grow something incredible.  SHARPpy exists in its current state today largely because of public contributions to the project.  

If you are a first-time contributor (or even a seasoned one), you may want to read up on how people can contribute to open-source projects.  Below are some links you may find helpful!

Some Norms 
^^^^^^^^^^

1. Input and output files for SHARPpy must be human readable text.  We are actively trying to avoid using a binary file format in SHARPpy because we do not want to force users to use SHARPpy to read, write, or understand their data.  In particular, we do not want data files floating around the Internet that require you to install SHARPpy to know what's in them.  We believe that the capability of viewing your data should not come with an additional software dependency. 
2. Small, incremental pull requests are desired as they allow the community (and other developers) to adapt their code to new changes in the codebase.
3. If you want to make a large change to the codebase, we recommended you contact the primary developers of the code so they can assist you in finding a good route of incorporating your code!
4. Communicate, communicate, communicate.  Use the Github Issues page to work through your coding problems.

Some Ideas
^^^^^^^^^^

Some possible ideas for contributions:

1. Contribute additional data sources so other program users can view other observed and NWP data (*cough*-ECMWF-*cough*)!
2. Add in additional insets into the program to facilitate additional analysis of the data.  
3. Search through the `GitHub Issues page <https://github.com/sharppy/SHARPpy/issues>`_ for additional ideas!
